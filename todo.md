## General direction

I just think I need to sketch out in what order I should be doing things now. How deep into security should I go?
Maybe just set up basic user functionality, and then focus on making a little MVP basically?

Very basic security + security. Then, probably focus on making it look ok. But remember to keep learning
**backend** things.
